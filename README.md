# Dual slider demo

## Getting started

This demo is built with React + TypeScript + Vite. If you are using NVM, run:

```
nvm use
```

If you are not using NVM, make sure you're on **Node 20**. Then, launch the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

## This demo features...

- React 18 plus TypeScript.
- Basic Sass setup with easy-to-use variables and mixins.
- Extended eslint configuration using `airbnb-typescript` and `simple-import-sort` for a universal code style.
- Atomic design principle within the `components` folder: elements, groups, sections and templates (smallest to largest).
- Support for a multilingual setup based on a string translation system.
- Some basic responsive styling via scoped Sass module files to make everything look a little nicer.
